# Google-Image-Scraper-SerpAPI
Scrapes images from google using SerpAPI

## Motivation

There exists a google image scraper that uses python selenium - great for small number of images but infeasible for my needs (20k+ images). 

SerpAPI makes the process a lot faster - though a paid subscription is required after 100 searches(100 images per search). 

## How to use

The jupyter notebook provided should be quite intuitive to understand and is commented. Make sure to add your API.
